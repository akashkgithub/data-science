Problem Statement & Solution :
Problem: In the telecom industry, customers are able to choose from multiple service providers and actively 
switch from one operator to another. In this highly competitive market, the telecommunications industry 
experiences an average of 15-25% annual churn rate. Given the fact that it costs 5-10 times more to 
acquire a new customer than to retain an existing one, customer retention has now become even more
important than customer acquisition.

Action: Predict which customers are at high risk of churn.

Using: Exploratory Data Analysis, Python Libraries, Machine Learning Models.

Steps:

1. Import Packages

2. Read and Understand given Data - The input CSV file is stored in AWS S3

3. Data Preparation

  3.1. Filter high value customers

  3.2. Remove columns having all zero values

  3.3. Remove columns having more percentage in number of zeros

  3.4. Imputing NaN with mean, mediam or mode for necessary columns

  3.5. Remove Outliers if found any by plotting graphs (histogram, boxplot)

  3.6. Derive any meaningful new features for further modelling

4. Model Building

  4.1. Split data in to Train and Test

  4.2. Feature Scaling & Churn rate

  4.3. Perform Principal Component Analysis (PCA) - Remove unwanted columns
    4.3.1. Logistic Regression with PCA (Confusion Matrix, Accuracy, ROC)
    4.3.2. Decision Tree Modeling with PCA
    4.3.3. Random Forest Modeling with PCA (Viz. critical features)
    
5. Conclusion - Verify the Accuracy of different models, and take necessary Action based on extracted features. Possible action could be - Contact the customers periodically who are in the risk of churn based on these concluded features and provide special service schemes to retain the customers.
